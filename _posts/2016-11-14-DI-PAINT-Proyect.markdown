Last year I didn't have time to taught git fundamentals to my students. Many former students informed us that git was something that was demanded in almost every job offer they wanted to apply. 

Futhermore, many of the actual students suggested that it would be a great idea to spend some time learning the basics of git. 

So this year I have spent some time creating a couple of base project on github they could work on.
